                <h2>What is Family Takaful? A Promise of Mutual Support.</h2>
                <p>Family Takaful is a Shariah-compliant mutual aid system designed to provide financial protection and security for you and your loved ones. Unlike conventional insurance, Takaful operates on principles of mutual assistance and shared responsibility.</p>
                <h3>The Ethical Difference:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No Riba (Interest):</strong> Contributions are managed ethically, avoiding interest-based transactions.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Maysir (Gambling):</strong> Focus is purely on mutual assistance and protection, not speculation.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Gharar (Uncertainty):</strong> Operations are transparent, reducing ambiguity in contracts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tabarru' (Donation):</strong> Your contributions are considered donations to a common fund, helping others in need.</li>
                    <li><strong>Surplus Sharing:</strong> Participants may receive a share of any surplus from the Takaful fund, demonstrating fairness and transparency.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For young Muslim families striving for halal financial solutions, Takaful offers a peace-of-mind solution that aligns perfectly with your values.</p>

                        <summary>Is Takaful truly Shariah-compliant?</summary>
                        <p>Yes, Family Takaful is fundamentally Shariah-compliant. It operates on principles of Tabarru' (donation), where participants contribute to a common fund for mutual assistance. Funds are managed according to Islamic finance principles, avoiding riba (interest), maysir (gambling), and gharar (excessive uncertainty), and are overseen by Shariah advisory councils.</p>
                    </details>
                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>How much Takaful coverage do I really need?</summary>
                        <p>The ideal coverage depends on several factors unique to your family, including your income, existing debts (e.g., housing loans), the number of dependents, your children's future education goals, and any specific liabilities. During our consultation, we'll help you assess these factors to determine the most suitable coverage amount for your peace of mind.</p>
                    </details>
                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>What happens to my contributions if I don't claim?</summary>
                        <p>Unlike conventional insurance, Takaful contributions are largely considered donations (Tabarru') to a common fund. If there's a surplus in the fund at the end of the year, a portion may be distributed back to participants (depending on the Takaful operator's policy), or transferred to a Waqf fund for community benefit. This reflects the ethical sharing principle of Takaful.</p>

                        <summary>How do I make a claim?</summary>
                        <p>Making a claim is designed to be as straightforward as possible. In the event of a covered incident, you or your family simply need to contact us directly. We will guide you through the necessary documentation and liaise with the Takaful operator to ensure a smooth and timely claim process.</p>

                        <summary>What is the difference between Family Takaful and General Takaful?</summary>
                        <p>Family Takaful focuses on protecting an individual's life and health, providing benefits for events like death, critical illness, or disability, often with an investment component for long-term savings. General Takaful, on the other hand, provides coverage for assets like property (e.g., car insurance, house insurance), business risks, or travel, for a shorter term.</p>
